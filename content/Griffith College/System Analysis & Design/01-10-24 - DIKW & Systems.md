## **Basic Systems**
### **Physical**
```
Static or Dynamic in nature.
```
	Example:
	A system-computer centre.
	Desks and chairs are the static parts
	Programs, data, and applications can change
	according to the user's needs
### **Abstract**
```
Abstract systems are conceptual. These are not
physical entities.
```
	Example:
	Formulas, representation, or model of a real system.

### **Open**
```
An open system has many interfaces with its
environment.
Can receive inputs from, and delivers output to the
outside of system.
```
### **Closed**
```
Systems that don't interact with
their environment. Closed systems exist in
concept only.
```

## **Man-made Information Systems**
	Information system is the basis for interaction
	between the user and the analyst.

Further Categorized as:
### Formal Information Systems:
- Responsible for flow of information from top
management to lower management
- But feedback can be given from lower authorities
to top management.
### Computer-Based Information Systems:
- This class of systems depends on the use of
computer for managing business applications

## **Categories of Information**
### Information can be categorized as:
- Strategic information
	- Strategic information is the information needed by
	top most management for decision making.
	- This information is not required by the lower levels
	in the organization.
	- The information systems that provide these kinds of
	information are known as Decision Support Systems
	(DSS).
	- For example the trends in revenues earned by
	the organization are required by the top
	management for setting the policies of the
	organization.
- Tactical information
	- required by the middle management
	- used for making short term decisions and plans for
	the organization
	- Management information system (MIS) caters to such
	information needs of the organization.
	- Information like sales analysis for the past quarter or
	yearly production details etc. fall under this category.
- Operational information.
	- relating to the daily or short term information needs
	of the organization such as attendance records of the
	employees.
	- This kind of information is required at the operational
	level for carrying out the day-to-day operational
	activities.
	- The information system is known as Transaction
	Processing System (TPS) or Data Processing System
	(DPS).
	- Some examples of information provided by such
	systems are processing of orders, posting of entries in
	bank, evaluating overdue purchaser orders etc.
## **COMPUTER BASED INFORMATION SYSTEMS**
### TPS - Transaction Processing Systems or Data Processing Systems
- TPS processes business transaction of the organization.
- Transaction can be any activity of the organization.
- Transactions differ from organization to organization.
- For example, take a railway reservation system.
- Booking, cancceling, etc are all transactions.
- Any query made to it is a transaction.
- Transaction processing systems provide speed and accuracy, and can be programmed to follow routines
functions of the organization.
### MIS - Management Information Systems
- These systems assist lower management in problem solving and making decisions.
- They use the results of transaction processing and some other information also.
- An important element of MIS system is database.
- And the information is accessed through DBMS.
- But there are two drawbacks of database i.e. requirement of a specialized personnel and need to secure data from unauthorized access.
- The three **sub-components**:
	- **System** emphasizing a fair degree of integration and a holistic view;
	- **Information** stressing on processed data in the context in which it is used by end users;
	- **Management** focusing on the ultimate use of such	information systems for managerial decision making.

### DSS - Decision Support Systems
- These systems assist higher management to make long term decisions.
- These type of systems handle unstructured or semi-structured decisions.
- A decision is considered unstructured if:
	1. there are no clear procedures for making the decision and
	2. if not all the factors to be considered in the decision can be readily identified in advance.
- The user should be able to produce customized reports by giving particular data and format specific to particular situations.
- Three fundamental components of a DSS architecture are:
	1. the database (or knowledge base).
	2. the model (i.e., the decision context and user criteria), and
	3. the user interface.
- The users themselves are also important components of the architecture.
- Using the relationship with the user as the criterion:
	1. A passive DSS is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions.
	2. An active DSS can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions.
	3. A cooperative DSS allows the decision maker (or its advisor) to modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation.
- Using the mode of assistance as the criterion:
	1. A communication-driven DSS supports more than one person working on a shared task; examples include integrated tools like Microsoft's NetMeeting or Groove.
	2. A data-driven DSS or data-oriented DSS emphasizes access to and manipulation of a time series of internal company data and, sometimes, external data.
	3. A document-driven DSS manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in variety of electronic formats.
	4. A knowledge-driven DSS provides specialized problem-solving expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures, or in similar structures.
	5. A model-driven DSS emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical, financial, optimization, or simulation model.
	6. Model-driven DSS use data and parameters provided by users to assist decision makers in analysing a situation; they are not necessarily data-intensive.
## **Uses of Information in a Business**
- Businesses and other organisations need
information for many purposes: we have
summarised the five main uses in the table
below.
1. **Planning**
	- To plan properly, a business needs to know what resources it has (e.g. cash, people, machinery and equipment, property, customers). It also needs information about the markets in which it operates and the actions of competitors. At the planning stage, information is important as a key ingredient in decision-making.
2. **Recording**
	- Information about each transaction or event is needed. Much of this is required to be collected by law - e.g. details of financial transactions. Just as importantly, information needs to be recorded so that the business can be properly managed.
3. **Controlling**
	- Once a business has produced its plan it needs to monitor progress against the plan - and control resources to do so. So information is needed to help identify whether things are doing better or worse than expected, and to spot ways in which corrective action can be taken.
4. **Measuring**
	- Performance must be measured for a business to be successful. Information is used as the main way of measuring performance. For example, this can be done by collecting and analysing information on sales, costs and profits.
5. **Decision-making**
	- Information used for decision-making is often categorised into three types:
		(1) Strategic information: used to help plan the objectives of the business as a whole and to measure how well those objectives are being achieved.
		Examples of strategic information include:
		- Profitability of each part of the business
		- Size, growth and competitive structure of the
		markets in which a business operates
		- Investments made by the business and the returns
		(e.g. profits, cash inflows) from those investments
		(2) Tactical Information: this is used to decide
		how the resources of the business should be
		employed. Examples include:
		- Information about business productivity (e.g. units
		produced per employee; staff turnover)
		- Profit and cash flow forecasts in the short term
		- Pricing information from the market.
		(3) Operational Information: this information
		is used to make sure that specific operational tasks
		are carried out as planned/intended (i.e. things are
		done properly). For example, a production manager
		will want information about the extent and results
		of quality control checks that are being carried out
		in the manufacturing process.
