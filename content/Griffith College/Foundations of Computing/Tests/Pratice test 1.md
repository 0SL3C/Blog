1. Given the set A = {x : x is natural number and x<4} in predicate form, write A
in enumerated form
```
x = {0, 1, 2, 3}
```
2. Given the set A = {x : 1 ≤ x ≤ 10 and x mod 5=0} in predicate form, write A
in enumerated form
```
A = { 5, 10 }
```
3. A = {1,3,5,7,9} in enumerated form. Write A in predicate form.
```
A = {x: x is a positive natural, odd, and x < 10};
```
5. Say whether each of the following is true or false
(i) java ⊂ {java, python,c++}
```
False, because java is an element, not a subset.
```
(ii) {java,c++} ⊂ {java, python,c++}
```
True
```
(iii) ∅ ⊂ {0,1}
```
True, NULL is a subset of every set.
```
(iv) {5,2}={5,2,2}
```
True
```
(v) {David,Jobish, Mary} ⊆ {Mary,David,Jobish}
```
True
```
(vi) Given B={b ∈ N: b is even number}, then 2 ⊂ B
```
False, would be true if 2 was inside a subset, {2}
```
(vii) Given C={1,2,2,2,3}, |C|=3(Cardinality)
```
True
```
5. Given the universal set U = {a,b,c,d,e,f} and the sets A = {a,b,c},
B = {c,d,e} Draw Venn diagram to show U, X and Y. (5 marks)

(i) Find A Ս B
= {a, b, c, d, e}

(ii) Find B Ո A
= {c}

(iii) Find B^c
= {a, b, f}

(iv) Find A\B
= A\B = {a, b}

(v) Find B \ U
= {NULL}

(vi) Find the cardinality of AC

6. Evaluate the below expression:
= (2/3 - 1/2) x 2/3
= (4 - 3)/6 x 2/3
= 1/6 x 2/3
= 2/18
= 1/9

= ((2/3) / (1/4)) + (2/6)
= (2/3 * 4/1) + 2/6
= 8/3 + 2/6
= 8/3 + 1/3
= 9/3
= 3

= (3/5 x 1/2) + (3/4 - 2/5)
= 3/10 + (15 - 8)/20
= 3/10 + 7/20
= 6/20 + 7/20
= 13/20

7. Remove the brackets and simplify the expression:
4(x - 5) + 3(5x – 4)
= 4x - 20 + 15x - 12
= 19x - 32

x(3x + 2) - 2(x^2 – 3)
= 3x^2 + 2x - 2x^2 - 6
= x^2 + 2x - 6

5(x + 2xy) - (x - 4y)
5y(2x+ y) +x(2y+x2)
8. Remove the brackets and solve the following equations:
4(x -3) =8
3x -4 =2x+7
3(x -4) = 4(x - 5)
2(x -3) = 3(x - 5) +5
9. Solve the following equation:
𝑥−3
2 = 2
2𝑥+8
4 = 3𝑥
