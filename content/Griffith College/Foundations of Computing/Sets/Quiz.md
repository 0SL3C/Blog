# Quiz 1
Question: In a group of 120 students, 84 can program in C and 66 can program in Java. If 45 can program in C and Java, how many of the students can not program in either of these languages?

Let U be {computing students}
Let C be {C programming students} 
Let J  be {Java programming students}

# Quiz 3
Write the following sets in the form	{x : x ...}
A	=	{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
B	=	{May, June, July}
C =	{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet}
D =	{4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}

A = {x: x is natural,  0 < x < 9}
B = {x: x is a month of summer}
C = {x: x is colours of the rainbow}
D = {x: x is an even number and 4 <= x <= 14}

Which of the following sets are equal?
A = {1, 3, 5, 7}, B = {7, 5, 9}, C = {5, 7, 9}, D = {1, 5, 7, 3}

**A = D**
**B = C**

If X = {letters of TITLE} and Y = {letters of LITTLE}, write down the elements of set X and  Y. 
Is X = Y true?

**Yes**


Given that
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, C = {3, 6, 9, 12}, D = ∅
State whether each of the following is true or false:
 B ⊂  A, **TRUE**
 B ⊂  C, **FALSE**
 D ⊂  B, **TRUE**
 C ⊂  A, **FALSE**
 B ⊂  B, **TRUE**

 
Write down all the subsets of {1, 2} and {a, b, c}

```
{1}, {2}, {1,2} 
```

```
{a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b,c}
```
