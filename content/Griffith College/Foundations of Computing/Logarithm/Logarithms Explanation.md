## In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation.
```
Example: log_2(4) = 2 because 2^2 = 4
log_b(x) = y is equals to b^y = x
```

# Logarithm rules
## Product rule:
### log_b(x\*y) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)
```
Example:
=log_2(32)
=log_2(8) + log_2(4), because 8*4 = 32
=3 + 2 = 5
=2^5 = 32
```

## Quotient rule:
### log_2(x/y) = log_2(x) - log_2(y)
```
Example:
=log_2(16) - log_2(4) = log_2(16/4) 
=log_2(4) = 2
```

## Power rule:
### log_b(x^n) = n \* log_b(x)
```
Example:
=log_2(16) = log_2(4^2) 
=2 * log_2(4)
=2 * 2 = 4
```

## Change of base:
### log_b(x) = log_c(x) / log_c(b)
```
Example:
=log_4(64) = log_2(64) / log_2(4)
=6 / 2
=3 
=4^3 = 64
```
## Identity rule: 
### log_b(b) = 1
```
Example:
=log_4(4) = 1
```

## Zero rule:
### log_b(1) = 0
```
Example:
=log_3(1) = 0
=3^0 = 1
```

## Common logarithm (base 10):
### Often denoted as log(x) without specific base. Is the same as log_10(x)
```
Example:
log(100) = log_10(100)
```

## Natural logarithm(Base e):
### Denoted as ln(x), ln stands for logarithm natural. e = ~2.71828
